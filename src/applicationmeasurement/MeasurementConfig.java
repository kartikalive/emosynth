			+ "Some remarks to help you get started:\n"
			+ " - Move over the affectbutton (the one with a face on it) to change the facial expression of the face. Left-mouse press on the affectbutton to record your selection. Pressing it again overwrites your selection.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Save & Continue' button if you think the selection fits with the affective state of the voice.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Repeat test' button if you would like to hear the same voice again.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Compare with neutral' button if you would like to hear a (synthetic) affective neutral voice.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Skip (I don't know)' button if you cannot make an accurate selection at all. Use only when you are clueless.\n"
