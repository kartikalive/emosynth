			+ "When you press the 'Save & Continue' button, we will automatically save your result to a file. In order to process your results, we would like you to send this file to us when you are done."
			+ "The file can be found in the location where you are running the program from. The filename is '[TODO INSERT FILENAME]'. Please send this file to '[TODO INSERT EMAILADDRESS]'.\n\n"
			+ "Some remarks to help you get started:\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Start' button to start with the first test.\n"
			+ " - Move over the affectbutton (the one with a face on it) to change the facial expression of the face. Left-mouse press on the affectbutton to record your selection. Pressing it again overwrites your selection.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Save & Continue' button if you think the selection fits with the affective state of the voice.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Repeat test' button if you would like to hear the same voice again.\n"
			+ " - Press the 'Compare with neutral' button if you would like to hear a (synthetic) affective neutral voice.\n"
			+ " - If you find it hard to select an affective state on the affectbutton; It does not record your selection if you move your mouse in between-mouse press and mouse-release.\n"
			+ " - If you don't really recognize the affective state in the voice, please listen to it again and make the best guess you can. Please don't pick randomly.\n\n"
